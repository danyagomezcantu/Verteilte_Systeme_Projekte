\section{Introduction}
This project aims to implement a task scheduler with a variety of strategies to distribute tasks across clients. The code is written in Python, and Docker containers are being used to simulate clients.

\section{Background Knowledge}
At the beginning of this project, we both had basic knowledge about distributed systems due to the course "Betriebssysteme und verteilte Systeme". Heiter had a little practice in working with Python Threads in his "Informatikprojekt". Besides these prerequisites, no further knowledge existed.

\section{Project Structure and Methodology}
The initial goal was to compare different scheduling algorithms towards different measurements. To make this as easy and comparable as possible, we created a single set of data to use across all implementations of sorting algorithms. The reason why we chose to use sorting algorithms as tasks is that those are easy to implement and estimate towards time and space complexity as they are already well documented. One dataset of numbers combined with different implementations of sorting algorithms results in a variety of tasks to use for scheduling comparison. Since it turned out to be more complex to implement multiple scheduling algorithms and to compare them, we agreed on getting a single scheduling algorithm to run.

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{New Technologies and Concepts}
Although Docker was not unknown to us, we had little to no experience with this technology. The basic concept was quite easy to grasp, but getting the first Docker container to run was bumpy and required intense studying of the guide given by the module "Betriebssysteme und verteilte Systeme".

\subsection{Scheduling Algorithms}
\subsubsection{Strategies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item First-Come First-Served
    \item Shortest-Job-Next
    \item Priority Scheduling
    \item Shortest Remaining Time
    \item Round Robin Scheduling
    \item Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-preemptive vs. Preemptive}
``In computing, preemption is the act of temporarily interrupting an executing task with the intention of resuming it at a later time.'' - \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)}{Wikipedia}

\begin{description}
    \item[Wait time:] Service Time - Arrival Time
    \item[Arrival Time:] Order of Arrival of each task
    \item[Service Time:] time stamp (accumulative) at which the task starts
\end{description}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Strategy} & \textbf{Preemptive or Non-preemptive} & \textbf{Performance towards Wait time} & \textbf{Principle Description} & \textbf{Requirements} \\
    \hline
    First Come First Serve (FCFS) & Non-preemptive & 575 & FIFO queue & none \\
    \hline
    Shortest Job Next (SJN) & Non-preemptive & 525 & Shortest first & CPU time \\
    \hline
    Priority Based Scheduling & Non-preemptive & 6 & Highest priority first, same priorities are dealt with FCFS & Amount of needed resource of interest (time, memory) \\
    \hline
    Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) & Preemptive version of SJN & ??? & The processor is allocated to the job closest to completion but it can be preempted by a newer ready job with shorter time to completion. & CPU time \\
    \hline
    Round Robin Scheduling & Preemptive & 85 & Each process is provided a fixed time to execute (quantum) & \\
    \hline
\end{tabularx}

\end{table}

\subsection{Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling}
Multiple-level queues are not an independent scheduling algorithm. They make use of other existing algorithms to group and schedule jobs with common characteristics. Multiple queues are maintained for processes with common characteristics. Each queue can have its own scheduling algorithms. Priorities are assigned to each queue. For example, CPU-bound jobs can be scheduled in one queue and all I/O-bound jobs in another queue. The Process Scheduler then alternately selects jobs from each queue and assigns them to the CPU based on the algorithm assigned to the queue.

\subsection{Parameters to Know}

    \item required CPU time

\section{Challenges and Learning}
During the implementation of this project, we encountered several challenges and learned valuable lessons. Although Docker was initially difficult to set up, we managed to create and run containers effectively by following the module guide and additional resources. Understanding and implementing different scheduling algorithms also provided insights into task management and resource allocation.

\section{Results and Discussion}
We implemented the "First Come First Serve" scheduling strategy due to its simplicity. This allowed us to get a first scheduling algorithm to run without dealing with the complexities of preemptive task states and preserving progress. Below is a comparison of the different scheduling strategies based on various performance metrics.

\subsection{Scheduling Algorithms Comparison Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Turnaround Time: Time span between beginning and end of process - the lower the more efficient
    \item Waiting Time: Time to wait before its execution begins - the lower the better the performance
    \item Response Time: Time the system needs to respond to a request
    \item CPU Utilization: Fraction of time the CPU is active - the higher the more efficient the system uses resources
    \item Throughput: Number of processes finished in a certain time span - the higher the throughput the higher the efficiency
    \item Fairness: Fair algorithms prevent starvation amongst processes (lack of resources)
    \item Context Switches: Counts of context switches - Less switches for less overhead and more efficiency
    \item Latency: Missed deadlines
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This project provided us with an opportunity to learn and implement task scheduling algorithms in a distributed system environment. We faced challenges in setting up Docker and understanding different scheduling strategies, but ultimately, we were able to create a functional task scheduler using the "First Come First Serve" strategy. Future work could involve implementing and comparing additional scheduling strategies and improving the system's efficiency.

\section{Introduction}
Distributed systems are integral to modern computing, enabling the efficient allocation of tasks across multiple machines. Task scheduling is a critical component in optimizing the performance and resource utilization of such systems. This project was undertaken to explore the intricacies of task scheduling, specifically within the context of distributed systems, and to evaluate the performance of different scheduling strategies.

In this paper, we detail the implementation of a task scheduler, outline the technical challenges encountered, and discuss the methods used to overcome them. The project serves both as a learning experience and as a practical application of theoretical concepts related to distributed systems.

\section{Background and Previous Knowledge}
The authors of this paper bring a background in computer science with a focus on distributed systems and programming. Prior to this project, we had substantial experience with Python, particularly in threading and concurrent programming. Our knowledge of Docker containers and virtualized environments provided a solid foundation for simulating a distributed system.

\section{Technical Implementation}
The core of this project involved developing a task scheduler capable of managing tasks across multiple nodes in a distributed system. The implementation was done using Python, leveraging its threading capabilities and compatibility with Docker for creating isolated client environments.

\subsection{System Architecture}
The system architecture consists of a master node responsible for task distribution and several worker nodes that execute the tasks. Docker containers were used to simulate these nodes, allowing for easy scalability and isolation of the different components.

\subsection{Scheduling Algorithms}
We implemented several scheduling algorithms to evaluate their performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Round Robin:} Tasks are assigned to workers in a cyclic order.
    \item \textbf{First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):} Tasks are assigned based on their arrival time.
    \item \textbf{Priority Scheduling:} Tasks are assigned based on their priority level.
    \item \textbf{Shortest Job Next (SJN):} Tasks with the shortest execution time are scheduled first.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
The implementation involved setting up the Docker environment, writing the scheduling logic in Python, and creating test scenarios to evaluate the performance of each algorithm. Key challenges included managing inter-process communication between containers and ensuring task completion without bottlenecks.

\subsection{Testing and Evaluation}
The system was tested under various load conditions, and the performance of each scheduling algorithm was measured. Metrics such as task completion time, resource utilization, and system throughput were recorded and analyzed.

\section{Results and Discussion}
Our testing revealed that the Round Robin and Priority Scheduling algorithms provided the most balanced performance in terms of task distribution and resource utilization. FCFS was simple to implement but often led to inefficiencies under heavy loads. SJN, while optimal in theory, was challenging to implement in a dynamic environment where task execution times were not known in advance.

The results highlight the trade-offs inherent in choosing a scheduling algorithm for distributed systems. Depending on the specific requirements of a system, different algorithms may be more suitable.

\section{Conclusion}
This project provided a deep dive into the challenges and complexities of task scheduling in distributed systems. Our implementation and evaluation of various scheduling strategies have provided valuable insights that can guide future work in this area. Future improvements could involve the integration of more sophisticated algorithms, such as those incorporating machine learning to predict task execution times more accurately.
